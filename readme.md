##Background
I had this idea long before I became a "professional" web developer, because I was looking for a web development role. Fast forward 3 years, I have a comfortable job making websites for a living. I have always been inspired by the idea of starting a "[Make something cool everyday.](https://www.behance.net/gallery/MSCED/976639)" type project. Plus [Michael Beruit is awesome](https://thegreatdiscontent.com/interview/michael-bierut) and assigns students to have [their own 100 days project](http://designobserver.com/feature/five-years-of-100-days/24678) which turns out amazing work. Plus I was thinking about how I have not been working on sideprojects. All of this culminated in my commitment to commit at least one commit on the jobist for the next 100 days. If I can't be bothered to get excited about the project beyond this experiment, then I give up on the jobist and will let the domain expire. If it is still awesome, I will keep it forever.
