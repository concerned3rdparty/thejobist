##Background
I had this idea long before I became a web developer, because I was looking for a web development role. Fast forward 3 years, I have a comfortable job making websites for a living. I have always been inspired by the idea of "Make something cool everyday." [Add link to the cool behance proj] Plus Michael Beruit is awesome and turns out assigns students to have their own 100 days project. [add link to the tgd article and linked list]. Plus I was thinking about how I have not been working on sideprojects. All of this culminated in my commitment to commit at least one commit on the jobist for the next 100 days. If I can't be bothered to get excited about the project beyond this experiment, then I give up on the jobist and will let the domain expire. If it is still awesome, I will keep it forever.
